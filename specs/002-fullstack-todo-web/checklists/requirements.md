# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase 2 - Full-Stack Todo Web Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-29
**Feature**: [specs/002-fullstack-todo-web/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - Note: Technology constraints referenced from constitution but not implementation details
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Content Quality | PASS | All 4 items pass |
| Requirement Completeness | PASS | All 8 items pass |
| Feature Readiness | PASS | All 4 items pass |

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/sp.plan`
- All requirements derived from Phase 2 Constitution
- No clarifications needed - all decisions specified in constitution
- 6 user stories covering complete CRUD + authentication flows
- 27 functional requirements defined
- 11 measurable success criteria
- Clear in-scope / out-of-scope boundaries

## Ready for Next Phase

**Status**: READY FOR PLANNING

The specification can proceed to `/sp.plan` or `/sp.clarify` (if additional refinement desired).
