# Filter and Sort Tasks Tasks Generation

## Original User Prompt

```
[No specific prompt provided - executed /sp.tasks command on the filter-sort-tasks feature]

## Assistant Response Summary

Generated comprehensive development tasks for the Filter and Sort Tasks feature based on the specification and implementation plan. The tasks.md file includes:

1. 56 specific, actionable tasks organized by implementation phases
2. Clear dependencies between user stories
3. Parallel execution opportunities identified
4. Task checklist format with proper IDs and story labels
5. Comprehensive test coverage including unit, integration, and contract tests
6. Edge case handling and error conditions
7. Backward compatibility considerations

The tasks follow the priority order from the specification (P1 for filtering and sorting, P2 for combined operations) and maintain compliance with the Phase 5 constitution.
