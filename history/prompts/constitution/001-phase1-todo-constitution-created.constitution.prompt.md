## Prompt

# Constitution — Phase I Todo Console Application

## 1. Purpose
This constitution governs the development of Phase I of the Hackathon II project:
an in-memory Python-based Todo console application built strictly using
Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

The goal is to demonstrate architectural thinking, not manual coding.

---

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Spec-Driven Only
- No code shall be written manually by the human developer.
- All code must be generated by Claude Code using written specifications.
- If output is incorrect, specifications must be refined — not code edited.

### 2.2 Single Source of Truth
- Specifications in `/specs` are the only authority.
- Code must strictly follow written specs.
- Error Handling

- Invalid task IDs must be handled gracefully
- Empty input must not crash the application
- User must receive friendly error messages

---

## 7. Development Workflow

1. Write or update specification
2. Ask Claude Code to generate plan
3. Ask Claude Code to implement
4. Validate against spec
5. Refine spec if needed

---

## 8. Forbidden Actions

- Writing Python code manually
- Skipping specs
- Adding extra features not defined in Phase I
- Using external libraries unnecessarily

---

## 9. Completion Criteria

Phase I is complete when:
- All 5 basic features work correctly
- App runs successfully from terminal
- Specs, Constitution, and history exist in repo
- Code strictly matches written specifications

---

## 10. Authority
This constitution overrides all assumptions and defaults.
Claude Code must follow this constitution without exception.
```

## Response snapshot

Created Phase I Todo Console Application Constitution v1.0.0 with:

**6 Core Principles:**
1. Spec-Driven Development Only (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
2. In-Memory Storage Only
3. CLI-Only Interface
4. Error Handling
5. Python Standard Library Only
6. Five Features Only

**Additional Sections:**
- Phase I Constraints (table format)
- Development Workflow (5-step process)
- Forbidden Actions (7 prohibited items)
- Completion Criteria (7 checkboxes)
- Governance (amendment procedure, version policy)

**Sync Impact Report** embedded as HTML comment showing template compatibility.

## Outcome

- Impact: Constitution established as supreme authority for Phase I development
- Tests: N/A (governance document)
- Files: 1 file created/updated (.specify/memory/constitution.md)
- Next prompts: /sp.specify for each of the 5 features
- Reflection: User provided comprehensive input; transformed into structured constitution with rationales

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - clear user input with complete requirements
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all placeholders filled, version set, dates ISO format
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor if constitution principles are referenced during /sp.plan and /sp.implement
