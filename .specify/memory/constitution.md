# Phase I Todo Console Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development Only (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- No code shall be written manually by the human developer
- All code MUST be generated by Claude Code using written specifications
- If output is incorrect, specifications MUST be refined — not code edited directly
- Specifications in `/specs` are the single source of truth
- Code MUST strictly follow written specs without deviation

**Rationale**: Demonstrates architectural thinking over manual coding; ensures traceability from requirement to implementation.

### II. In-Memory Storage Only

- All data MUST be stored in Python data structures (lists, dictionaries)
- No databases (SQL, NoSQL, SQLite) are permitted
- No file persistence (JSON, CSV, text files) is permitted
- Data exists only during runtime and is lost when program exits

**Rationale**: Phase I focuses on core logic and CLI interaction without persistence complexity.

### III. CLI-Only Interface

- The application MUST use command-line interface only
- User interaction via `print()` and `input()` functions
- No GUI, web interface, or API endpoints
- Menu-driven navigation with numbered options (1-5)

**Rationale**: Simplest viable interface for demonstrating CRUD operations.

### IV. Error Handling

- Invalid task IDs MUST be handled gracefully
- Empty input MUST NOT crash the application
- User MUST receive friendly, descriptive error messages
- All edge cases MUST be specified before implementation

**Rationale**: Robust user experience even in a minimal application.

### V. Python Standard Library Only

- No external packages beyond Python standard library
- No pip install requirements
- Application MUST run with vanilla Python 3.x installation

**Rationale**: Zero dependency overhead; focus on core Python skills.

### VI. Five Features Only

Phase I includes exactly these features:
1. Add Todo - Create new todo item
2. List Todos - Display all todos with status
3. Mark Complete - Toggle todo completion status
4. Delete Todo - Remove todo from list
5. Exit - Terminate application gracefully

No additional features may be added in Phase I.

**Rationale**: Bounded scope prevents feature creep; clear completion criteria.

## Phase I Constraints

| Constraint | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| Storage | In-memory only (Python list/dict) |
| Interface | CLI text-based menu |
| Persistence | None - data lost on exit |
| Users | Single user, no authentication |
| Dependencies | Python standard library only |
| Features | Exactly 5 (Add, List, Complete, Delete, Exit) |

## Development Workflow

1. Write or update specification in `/specs`
2. Ask Claude Code to generate plan (`/sp.plan`)
3. Ask Claude Code to implement (`/sp.implement`)
4. Validate implementation against spec
5. Refine spec if behavior incorrect (never edit code directly)

## Forbidden Actions

The following actions are strictly prohibited:

- Writing Python code manually (human developer)
- Skipping specifications before implementation
- Adding features not defined in Phase I scope
- Using external libraries or packages
- Editing generated code directly (refine spec instead)
- Persisting data to files or databases
- Creating GUI or web interfaces

## Completion Criteria

Phase I is complete when ALL of the following are true:

- [ ] All 5 basic features work correctly
- [ ] Application runs successfully from terminal (`python main.py`)
- [ ] Specs exist in `/specs` for each feature
- [ ] Constitution exists at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- [ ] Prompt history exists in `history/prompts/`
- [ ] Code strictly matches written specifications
- [ ] No manual code edits were made

## Governance

This constitution is the supreme authority for Phase I development:

- Constitution overrides all assumptions and defaults
- Claude Code MUST follow this constitution without exception
- Amendments require explicit documentation and version increment
- All implementation work MUST verify compliance before proceeding
- Violations MUST be reported and corrected via spec refinement

### Amendment Procedure

1. Propose change with rationale
2. Document impact on existing specs/code
3. Increment version (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
4. Update dependent artifacts
5. Record in prompt history

### Version Policy

- **MAJOR**: Backward incompatible changes (principle removal/redefinition)
- **MINOR**: New principles or sections added
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, typos, non-semantic refinements

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-28 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-28
